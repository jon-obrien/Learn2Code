What is required to prevent infinite recursion?,,Base case to stop recursion,Return statement,Void function,Static variable
What happens without a base case?,,Stack overflow,Infinite loop,Compilation error,Memory leak
What is the base case for factorial of 0?,,"return 1","return 0","return -1","return NULL"
What is the recursive formula for factorial?,,n * factorial(n-1),factorial(n) * n,n + factorial(n-1),factorial(n+1)
